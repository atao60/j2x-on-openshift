A Java to Xtend converter online 
==========

Rational
-------

The aim of this project was to trial the [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) platform. To do it, what 
about a Java to Xtend converter online using an other project of mine, 
i.e. [java2xtend](https://github.com/atao60/java2xtend.git).  

It used the version 2.9.0.beta3 of *Xtend*.
